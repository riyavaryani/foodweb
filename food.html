			<h1>THE FOOD YOU LOVE</h1>
			<p>The bond between food and us is like other relationships in our life: complicated, evolving, demanding, and in need of constant work. But together we’ve come so far, moving from my childhood obligation to clean our plate, to a mindless need to fill up, to a truly nourishing and pleasurable exchange. That’s the real reward.</p>

<h2 class="product_heading">Spaghetti Noodles</h2>
<p>Spaghetti is essentially a long, thin, cylindrical, solid pasta. It is made of milled wheat and water. Italian spaghetti is made from durum wheat semolina, but elsewhere it may be made with other kinds of flour (multi-grain/ whole wheat). Noodle is the base for both Spaghetti and Chowmein.</p>

<h2 class="product_heading">Dosa</h2>
<p>A dosa is a cooked flat thin layered rice batter, originating from the Indian subcontinent, made from a fermented batter. It is somewhat similar to a crepe in appearance. Its main ingredients are rice and black gram ground together in a fine, smooth batter with a dash of salt.</p>

<h2 class="product_heading">Biryani</h2>
<p>A world-renowned Indian dish, biryani takes time and practice to make but is worth every bit of the effort. Long-grained rice (like basmati) flavored with exotic spices, such as saffron, is layered with lamb, chicken, fish, or vegetables, and a thick gravy. The dish is then covered, its lid secured with dough, and then the biryani is cooked over a low flame. This is definitely a special occasion dish.</p>
